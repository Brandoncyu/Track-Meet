### Create a Card

There are three attribute fields by default, but if you would like to add more, click the add "attribute" button, outlined below in red.

You can add as many cards as you like. It is NOT required for you to fill in EVERY field in the form, you can choose to leave some out. The cards will still render, as shown below. The only thing you need to add is a first name.

### Card Features

Each card has buttons that allows you to update and delete your card.

When you press "update", all the information will re-render in the "Create" form for you to make edits. In this case, we are changing the name of "New Person" to "First Person"

### Search and Sort Your Cards

If you want to search your cards to see if it matches a certain value you have in mind, open the "Search Your Cards" menu item on the left. A new form will open.

Type in any keyword and press "Search", all cards containing your keyword will render. To re-render all of your cards, click the "Reset" button in your form.

Note: You will NOT be able to update and delete your cards directly after you make your search, hence why the buttons have disappeared. The buttons will re-appear after you reset.

You can also sort your cards in order of first name, last name, and date of meeting. You can do this by opening the "Sort Your Cards" menu item. Click any of the buttons to make your search. This time, you WILL be able to make updates and delete cards as well!
